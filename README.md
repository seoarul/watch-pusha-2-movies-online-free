Can I upgrade or downgrade my Hostinger plan easily
Yes, you can easily upgrade or downgrade your Hostinger plan. Here’s how the process works for both actions:

## Upgrading Your Hostinger Plan
1. **Access Your Account**: Log in to your Hostinger account.
2. **Navigate to Websites Section**: Go to the **Websites** section.
3. **Select Upgrade**: Click on the ellipsis button (⋯) next to your current hosting plan and select **Upgrade**. Alternatively, you can find the upgrade option in the **Dashboard** or **Billing** sections.
4. **Choose New Plan**: Select the new hosting plan you wish to upgrade to and complete the payment.
5. **Automatic Data Transfer**: The upgrade process will automatically transfer all your website data, including files and emails, to the new plan. The remaining period from your old plan will also be added to your new plan’s duration[4][5].

## Downgrading Your Hostinger Plan
1. **Contact Support**: Unlike upgrading, downgrading requires you to contact Hostinger's customer support. You can do this through the support button in your account or by emailing support@hostinger.com.
2. **Request Downgrade**: Inform them of your current plan and the plan you wish to downgrade to. They will guide you through the process.
3. **Data Transfer Assurance**: Ensure that all your website data will be transferred without loss during the downgrade[1][6].

### Important Notes
- There are typically no refunds for downgrades; however, any unused time from your original plan may extend the expiration date of your new plan[6].
- It's advisable to check with support regarding any potential impacts on website performance during and after the downgrade.

By following these steps, you can manage your Hostinger plans according to your needs effectively.
